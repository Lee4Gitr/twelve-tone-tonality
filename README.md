<h1>Twelve Tone Tonality

<h2>Purpose

*This website will provide tools and documents to be used by musicians to create, explore, and analyze serial music with more breadth than what is normally offered with a 4-year undergraduate degree.

<h2>Objectives

<h3>Tools
1 This website is a side project to produce musical arrays within the serial idiom. Specifically, this project will produce standard twelve tone matrices given a tone row as you would normally expect a matrix generator to do, as well as arrays according to George Perle's book "Twelve Tone Tonality", and also label and list Hauer's hexachordal tropes.
<h3>Composition 
2 There will be explanations as to how to use these tools in personal compositions as well as explanations for other compositional aspects of music. (i.e. form, deviations from schemata, harmonic function, etc.)
<h3>Analysis
3 Analysis of music will also be added. The focus will be to analyze serial music which means a large portion of analysis will be done using set analysis techniques. Other forms of analysis (roman numeral, Neo-Riemannian, and Schenkerian) may be used when deemed necessary to elucidate certain pieces or phrases.

<h2>Languages

*The website will be built using HTML CSS and JavaScript. It will also use Bootstrap for layout and design purposes.
